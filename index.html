                    <p>&#128073 In HTML, for example, the <code><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b></code> element, which gives the text
                        it wraps
                        around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your
                        page"
                    </p>
                    <details>
                        <summary><mark>Here is top level heading</mark></summary>
                    </details>
                    <p>&#128073 By default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an
                        <code><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b></code> with a
                        large font size to make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look like
                        anything
                        you wanted). On the other hand, you could make ay element look like a top level heading.

                    </details>
                    <p>&#8680 This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it
                        will not get
                        any extra benefits as discribed above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element
                        for the
                        right
                        job.</p>
                    <p>&#8680 HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its
                        default
                        presentation styling. Presentation (how it look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.

                    &#11088 <mark>SEO (Search Engine Optimization</mark> is the process of making a website more visible
                    in
                    search
                    results, also termed improving search rankings.
                </p>
                <p>&#11088 Search engines <strong>crawl</strong> the web, following links from page to page, and index
                    the
                    content
                    found. When you search, the search engine displays the indexed content. Crawlers follow rules. If
                    you
                    follow those rules closely when doing SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of
                    showing
                    up among the first results, increasing traffic and possibly revenue (<em>for ecommerce and
                        ads</em>).
                </p>
                <p> &#11088 Search engines give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines keep results ranking as
                    a trade
                    secret. SEO combines official search engine guidlines, empirical knowledge, and theoretical
                    knowledge
                    from science papers or patents.
